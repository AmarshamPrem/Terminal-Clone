## üéÆ How to Play

1. **Starting the Game**
   ```bash
   python gameTerminal.py
   ```

2. **First-time Setup**
   - Enter a username and password when prompted
   - You'll start with $1000 in virtual money

3. **Basic Gameplay Loop**
   1. Use `get stin` to check current stock performances
   2. Analyze which stocks are performing well
   3. Use `invest` command to buy stocks
   4. Monitor your money using `get money`

4. **Investment Strategy**
   - Stocks perform randomly between -100% and +100%
   - Positive performance means profit
   - Negative performance means loss
   - Start with small investments to learn the system

## üí° Learning Tips

1. **Start Small**
   - Begin with small investments
   - Try investing $100 in different stocks
   - Compare results to understand the random nature of returns

2. **Track Your Progress**
   - Keep notes of which stocks perform well
   - Record your starting and ending amounts
   - Try to develop investment strategies

3. **Experiment Safely**
   - Try different investment amounts
   - Test various combinations of stocks
   - Learn from losses without real financial risk

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

The game uses:
- Python's built-in `json` module for data persistence
- Random number generation for stock performance
- File I/O for saving user data
- Command pattern for handling user input
- Dictionary-based command documentation

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements

1. **Base Requirements**
   - Python 3.x
   - JSON module (built-in)

2. **For Code Execution Features**
   - Python interpreter
   - Node.js for JavaScript
   - JDK for Java
   - G++ compiler for C++
   - GCC compiler for C
   - Ruby interpreter
   - PHP interpreter
   - Perl interpreter
   - Bash shell
   - PowerShell

## üîß File Structure

- `gameTerminal.py` - Main application file containing all logic
- `user.json` - User data storage file
- `README.md` - Documentation and guide (this file)
- Created files - Stored in user-specified locations

## üéì Educational Exercise Ideas

1. **Code Study**
   - Review the JSON file handling
   - Understand the command processing system
   - Study the error handling implementation

2. **Possible Enhancements**
